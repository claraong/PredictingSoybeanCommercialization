This was a group project for ORIE4741 Learning with Big Messy Data. Given soybean experimental data (eg yield, relative maturity), we predicted whether a soybean would graduate from tests ie proceed to be commercialized. Three classification models were developed - Adaboost, Naive Bayes and K Means. Adaboost had the best F score (harmonic mean of the precision and recall) on the training and test sets.
